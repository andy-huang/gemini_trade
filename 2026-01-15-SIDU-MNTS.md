## Reasoning

**Momentus Inc. (MNTS)** is selected as the Winning Stock based on the following:

1.  **Strong Momentum:** MNTS is up **6.92%** today, significantly outperforming SIDU and all other related stocks which are mostly in the red.
2.  **Bullish Catalyst:** The recent announcement regarding its additive-manufactured fuel tank has acted as a massive catalyst, previously driving an 80% surge. The current price action suggests this momentum is intact or consolidating for another leg up.
3.  **Sentiment Divergence:** While analysts are cautious ("Sell" ratings due to financials), **retail sentiment is "extremely bullish."** In the short term (10 days), retail sentiment and momentum often override fundamental concerns, especially for small-cap space stocks.
4.  **Relative Strength:** Compared to peers like SPRC (delisting fears) or SIDU (profitability concerns), MNTS has a positive narrative driving price *now*.
5.  **Short-Term Potential:** The combination of a tech breakthrough news cycle and high retail engagement creates a volatile but high-probability setup for a >10% move, essentially a continuation of the breakout.
