# UMAC and Winning Stock

## Conclusion
The original stock **UMAC (Unusual Machines)** is performing steadily (+0.85%) supported by recent drone component orders and a favorable regulatory shift away from Chinese drones. While positive, its momentum is overshadowed by stronger fundamental catalysts in its peer group.

The **Winning Stock** is **PDYN (Palladyne AI Corp)**. PDYN is up ~4.7% today, continuing its momentum after recently raising its full-year 2026 revenue guidance to $24.0M–$27.0M. This implies a massive year-over-year growth trajectory (over 300%), signaling a major inflection point in its business operations. The market is rewarding this tangible improvement in outlook.

## People Also Watch Stocks
*   **RCAT (Red Cat)**: Down ~11% today as investors take profits after a massive run-up; strong long-term but currently correcting.
*   **ONDS (Ondas)**: Down ~8% due to dilution concerns from a convertible preferred share sale.
*   **DPRO (Draganfly)**: Up ~2.9% but struggling with missed earnings recently.
*   **ZENA (ZenaTech)**: Up ~0.24% (intraday volatility) on positive drone swarm testing news.

## Reasoning
**PDYN (Palladyne AI)** is selected as the winner because its catalyst—a significant raise in revenue guidance—provides the strongest fundamental justification for upside. While UMAC is solid, PDYN's projected growth rate (336-440%) is explosive and directly addresses valuation. In a sector currently facing volatility (as seen with RCAT and ONDS), PDYN's improving financial guidance offers a clear "buy" signal that stands out against the noise.
