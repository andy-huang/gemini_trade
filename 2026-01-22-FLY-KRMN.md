# FLY and Winning Stock

## Conclusion
The original stock **FLY (Firefly Aerospace)** has potential with a 33% upside to analyst targets and upcoming launch catalysts, but it is currently in a downtrend (-7.7% recently). The **Winning Stock** identified is **Karman Holdings (KRMN)**, which has just released a powerful positive catalyst: raised fiscal 2025/2026 guidance and a strategic acquisition, triggering a ~9% surge.

## Reasoning
**Karman Holdings (KRMN)** is selected as the winning stock because it offers the highest probability of a sustained >10% return in the next 10 days, driven by a confirmed fundamental breakout rather than speculation.
1.  **Catalyst:** On Jan 22, KRMN raised its FY2025 and FY2026 revenue and EBITDA guidance, beating analyst expectations. It also announced a value-accretive $220M acquisition.
2.  **Momentum:** The stock surged ~9% in response, validating market approval. Analysts (Evercore ISI, Raymond James) immediately raised price targets (e.g., to $125).
3.  **Safety:** Unlike VOYG, FLY, or AIRO which are currently selling off, KRMN is in a confirmed uptrend with fundamental backing.
4.  **Upside:** With a new target of $125 against a price of ~$108 (before the full surge effect settles), there is still significant double-digit upside potential as the market reprices the stock to the new guidance.
