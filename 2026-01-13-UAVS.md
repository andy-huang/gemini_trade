# UAVS and Winning Stock

## Reasoning
The analysis of **UAVS (AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc.)** and its related stocks reveals a sector experiencing significant momentum driven by government and public sector contracts.

**UAVS** itself is a strong performer, having gained over 30% on January 13, 2026, following the announcement of drone sales to the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the U.S. Army. This provides a solid fundamental catalyst for continued growth.

However, the "Winning Stock" for a potential 10% return in the next 10 days is identified as **MARK (Remark Holdings, Inc.)**. 
1. **Strategic Catalyst**: MARK recently announced a strategic collaboration with **Google Public Sector** to implement its computer vision AI technology in New York State. This is a massive tailwind for a micro-cap stock.
2. **Technical Breakout**: The stock saw a 125% increase on January 12, 2026, triggered by a buy signal from a pivot bottom point.
3. **Recovery Potential**: The agreement with Mudrick Capital to strengthen the balance sheet and the goal of re-listing on a national exchange provide a clear path for valuation recovery.

**VISL (Vislink Technologies)** is also a notable mention due to its upcoming earnings on January 16 and a high analyst price target, but MARK's recent Google partnership news offers higher immediate speculative momentum.
