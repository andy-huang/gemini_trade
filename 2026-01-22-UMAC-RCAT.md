# UMAC and Winning Stock

## Conclusion
The original stock **Unusual Machines (UMAC)** is a strong performer, trading at ~$17.00 near all-time highs. It is profitable, cash-rich ($133M), and a "Top Pick" for 2026. However, the "Winning Stock" is **Red Cat Holdings (RCAT)**, trading at $17.07. RCAT is selected because of its explosive pre-announced revenue growth of **1,842%** for Q4, confirming it is capturing the immediate demand from the U.S. drone ban policy shift.

## People Also Watch Stocks
*   **RCAT (Red Cat Holdings):** **WINNER**. The leader of the pack. Pre-announced $24M-$26M revenue for Q4 (up 1842%). Northland raised target to $22. This is the primary beneficiary of the "Blue UAS" shift.
*   **DPRO (Draganfly):** $9.37. Struggling with execution (Q3 miss), though new leadership (Executive Chairman) might help. Lags behind the explosive growth of UMAC/RCAT.
*   **ONDS (Ondas):** $12.47. Strong pipeline ($500M) and raised guidance, but the stock is consolidating after a capital raise. Good long-term, but less immediate momentum than RCAT.
*   **ZENA (ZenaTech):** $5.01. Speculative "quantum drone" play. Up 13% recently, but much earlier stage than the revenue-generating machines of RCAT/UMAC.
*   **PDYN (Palladyne AI):** $7.29. A strong runner-up. Massive guidance hike (336-440% growth) and BlackRock investment make it very attractive, but RCAT's *confirmed* sales breakout is a safer bet on the same theme.

## More Stocks (Related to RCAT)
*   **RDW (Redwire):** $11.80. Space infrastructure play moving to industrial scale. Up 50% recently, but significant insider selling is a caution flag.
*   **LUNR (Intuitive Machines):** $19.76. Recent acquisition of Lanteris is positive, but insider selling and a Stifel downgrade suggest short-term headwinds.

## Reasoning
**Red Cat Holdings (RCAT)** is the "Winning Stock" because it has provided the most concrete evidence of a fundamental inflection point. The **1,842% revenue growth** is not just a projection; it's a pre-announced reality that validates the thesis of Western militaries shifting to domestic drone suppliers. While UMAC is also an excellent company with a strong balance sheet (and indeed, they are likely partners/peers in this ecosystem), RCAT's top-line explosion offers the most direct exposure to the "demand shock" currently hitting the sector. The stock is breaking out to new highs, supported by analyst upgrades, making it the prime candidate for >10% short-term returns.
