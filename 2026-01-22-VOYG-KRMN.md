# VOYG and Winning Stock

## Conclusion
The original stock **Voyager Space (VOYG)** is trading at $33.11. While it has secured a new ISS contract and holds a valuable in-space manufacturing patent, its recent price action has been mixed with some pre-market weakness. The "Winning Stock" identified is **Karman Holdings (KRMN)**, currently trading at $110.01. KRMN is selected because of a massive fundamental catalyst: a guidance upgrade projecting fiscal 2026 revenue of $700M-$715M (vs $470M previously), driven by its strategic acquisition of Seemann and MSC.

## People Also Watch Stocks
*   **KRMN (Karman Holdings):** **WINNER**. Surged ~5-9% on major guidance hike. Revenue forecast nearly doubled for 2026. RBC raised price target to $125. Breakout momentum to new highs.
*   **CHYM (Chime Financial):** $27.05. Down recently due to insider selling, despite a Goldman upgrade.
*   **AIRO (AIRO Group):** $12.43. Volatile. Revenue doubled but losses widened. Defense budget skepticism remains a headwind.
*   **FLY (Firefly Aerospace):** $29.72. Mixed bag. Recent 7.7% drop counters the positive earnings beat.
*   **RDW (Redwire):** $11.97. Negative sentiment. Earnings miss and insider selling caused a recent gap down.

## More Stocks (Related to KRMN)
*   **LOAR (Loar Holdings):** $74.48. Solid compounder with record sales and acquisitions, but lacks the explosive immediate catalyst that KRMN possesses today.
*   **FIGR (Figure Technology):** $63.51. Recently surged 27% to record highs, but analyst targets suggest it is now overvalued (downside risk).
*   **VOYG (Voyager Space):** $33.17. Stable but lacks the "event-driven" upside of KRMN.

## Reasoning
**Karman Holdings (KRMN)** is the winning stock because it is experiencing a "step-change" in valuation. The announcement of updated guidance ($700M revenue in 2026) fundamentally reprices the company. Unlike **FIGR** which has already run up 27% (and is now trading above analyst targets), KRMN is in the early stages of pricing in this new growth trajectory. The "gap up" and breakout to new 12-month highs indicates strong institutional demand, supported by the RBC price target hike to $125. This momentum is likely to continue over the next 10 days as the market digests the magnitude of the guidance upgrade.
