# SIDU and Winning Stock

## Conclusion
The original stock **Sidus Space (SIDU)** is currently trading at $3.37.

*   **ENSC (Ensysce Biosciences):** $0.87. Clinical trial progress is good, but financing and penny stock volatility present risks.

## Reasoning
**Momentus Inc. (MNTS)** is selected as the winning stock because it possesses the most potent combination of **momentum** and **news catalyst**. The announcement of a 3D-printed fuel tank for space missions is a tangible technological advancement that captures market imagination, evidenced by the recent 44% price surge. Coupled with the $5 million private placement which alleviates immediate cash concerns, the stock has a clear runway for short-term appreciation. Unlike SIDU which is consolidating, or LUNR which faces insider selling pressure, MNTS is in a breakout phase driven by fundamental news. The >10% return target is highly plausible given the recent volatility and volume in the stock.
