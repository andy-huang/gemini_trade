## Winning Stock Selection
**Winning Stock: VG**

### Reasoning
VG is selected as the winning stock with the highest probability of a >10% return in the next 10 days due to:
1.  **High Volatility & Low Price:** At ~$7.70, a $0.80 move is enough to trigger a >10% gain. The stock has already demonstrated this capacity with a recent 10% daily jump.
2.  **Sector Momentum:** The entire Natural Gas/LNG complex (EQT, AR, RRC, NEXT) is bid up. VG, being a more speculative/growth-oriented name, tends to outperform (beta) in bullish sector moves.
3.  **Short Squeeze/Rebound Potential:** Being down 70% from IPO, any positive news (like the current weather patterns) forces a rapid repricing of the "oversold" condition.
4.  **Immediate Catalyst:** The ongoing winter freeze and the upcoming 1-year IPO anniversary (Jan 24) could generate increased trading interest and coverage.

## Data Points
*   **Original Stock:** VG ($7.70)
*   **People Also Watch:** EGHT, NEXT, EQT, RNG, ANGI
*   **Winning Stock:** VG
