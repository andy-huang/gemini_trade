# SOUN and Winning Stock

## Conclusion

The original stock **SOUN (SoundHound AI)** is facing headwinds (-2.04% today) with mixed sentiment, as insider selling and valuation concerns dampen the enthusiasm from its recent CES product demos. The "Winning Stock" selected is **QBTS (D-Wave Quantum)**. QBTS stands out with a "Predominantly Positive" sentiment profile, highlighted by recent "Outperform" and "Buy" initiations from major analysts (Wedbush, Jefferies) with price targets significantly above current levels. While the stock is flat today (+0.03%), this stability amidst a positive news flow suggests a consolidation phase before a potential breakout, offering a better risk/reward ratio than the falling SOUN.
