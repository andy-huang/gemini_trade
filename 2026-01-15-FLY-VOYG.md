# FLY and Winning Stock

## Conclusion

The original stock **FLY (Firefly Aerospace)** has shown positive momentum (+0.63% today, +36% over the last week) driven by institutional accumulation and sector bullishness. However, the "Winning Stock" selected is **VOYG (Voyager Technologies)**. VOYG presents a more compelling risk/reward profile with a "Strong Buy" consensus, a potential >25% upside, and recent positive catalysts (NASA contract renewal) that outweigh the short interest concerns. While FLY is performing well, VOYG's recent dip (-0.41%) amidst positive news suggests a buying opportunity before a potential rebound, whereas FLY is already running hot.
