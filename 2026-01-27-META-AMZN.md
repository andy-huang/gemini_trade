# META and Winning Stock

## Conclusion
The original stock **META (Meta Platforms)** is showing strong momentum (+8% in 5 days) heading into its Q4 earnings on Jan 28. While promising, the immediate binary event of earnings presents significant volatility risk.

The **Winning Stock** is **AMZN (Amazon)**. Amazon presents a compelling case for a steady run-up over the next 10 days. With earnings scheduled for Feb 5, it has a clear "pre-earnings run" window. Recent cost-cutting measures (closing physical stores, reducing UPS reliance) and a new $581M cloud contract with the U.S. Air Force have led analysts (Roth Capital) to raise their price target to $295.

## People Also Watch Stocks
*   **META**: Strong AI progress, but faces immediate earnings volatility.
*   **AAPL**: Down YTD, margins concerns despite iPhone 17 hype.
*   **GOOG**: Strong cloud growth (+34%), but regulatory headwinds (EU) dampen short-term sentiment.
*   **TSLA**: Negative outlook. Missed deliveries, earnings expected to drop 40%.
*   **NFLX**: Good quarter, but stock is off its highs.

## More Stocks (from GOOG)
The related stocks for GOOG were the same major tech peers (AAPL, AMZN, META, TSLA, NFLX), so the analysis remains consistent.

## Reasoning
**AMZN** is selected as the winner because it combines positive fundamental news (margin improvement via cost cuts, new revenue via Cloud contract) with a favorable technical setup. Unlike META and AAPL, which report earnings in the next 1-2 days, AMZN reports on Feb 5. This allows for a "run into earnings" trade for the majority of the 10-day target window, supported by the recent analyst price target hike to $295. The stock is already showing strength today (+1.5%), confirming investor appetite.
