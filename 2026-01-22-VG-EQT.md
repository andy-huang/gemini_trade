# VG and Winning Stock

## Conclusion
The original stock **Venture Global (VG)** is trading at $9.53. While it has secured long-term contracts (20-year deal with Atlantic-See LNG), it has recently lowered its 2025 profit forecast due to pricing and transport issues. The "Winning Stock" identified is **EQT Corporation (EQT)**, currently trading at $54.50. EQT is selected because it is the market leader best positioned to capitalize on the immediate catalyst of a severe cold snap driving up natural gas prices, unlike VG which is facing operational headwinds.

## People Also Watch Stocks
*   **EQT (EQT Corporation):** **WINNER**. The largest U.S. natural gas producer. Benefiting directly from the current "cold snap" and spiking gas futures. Recently completed the strategic acquisition of Equitrans Midstream.
*   **NEXT (NextDecade):** $4.975. Trading at 52-week lows. Missed earnings estimates and carries "Reduce/Sell" analyst ratings. Long-term potential with Rio Grande LNG (2027), but short-term momentum is very negative.
*   **EGHT (8x8):** $1.705. Tech/VoIP stock. Unrelated to the energy theme of VG. Revenue growth is sluggish (1.7%).
*   **RNG (RingCentral):** $27.07. Tech/Cloud stock. "Hold" ratings with some insider selling. Not a sector match for VG's LNG business.
*   **ANGI (Angi Inc):** $13.20. Consumer services. Completely unrelated sector.

*   **LNG (Cheniere Energy):** (Implied peer, though not in the direct list, it is the standard benchmark). EQT is preferred for immediate upstream exposure to gas price spikes.

## Reasoning
**EQT Corporation (EQT)** is the clear winner because it offers immediate upside from the current commodities environment (winter demand spike). While VG is a valid long-term LNG player, its recent guidance cut is a red flag for short-term performance. EQT, on the other hand, is firing on all cylinders with its midstream integration and successful execution of environmental goals (Net Zero Scope 1/2 met). The disparity in sentiment—VG cutting guidance vs. EQT benefiting from macro tailwinds—makes EQT the superior buy for the next 10 days.
